* tonemapper

A python script to debug tonemapping operators.
It plots the following filmic tonemapper curves with a fixed set of parameters:

The settings for the Generic tonemapper are:
- Contrast = 1.25
- Shoulder = 0.975
- Mid in   = 0.33
- Mid out  = 0.18

The settings for the Piecewise tonemapper are:
- x0, y0 = 0.25
- x1, y1 = 0.6
- overshoot x = HDR max * 4
- overshoot y = 1.5

Both the Uncharted and ACES curve have been normalized to HDR max.

Linear curves are included for reference. Clamped to 1 and normalized to [0, HDR max], respectively.
