* tonemapper

A python script to debug tonemapping operators.
It compares the following tonemappers:

2. [[http://filmicgames.com/archives/75][John Hable "Uncharted" Filmic]]
3. [[https://knarkowicz.wordpress.com/2016/01/06/aces-filmic-tone-mapping-curve/][Krzysztof Narkowicz ACES approximation]]

The settings for the Generic Tonemapper are:
- Contrast = 1.25
- Shoulder = 0.975
- Mid in   = 0.33
- Mid out  = 0.18
- HDR max  = 16.0

Both the Uncharted and ACES curve have been normalized to 16, 
which is the same value as HDR max for the Generic tonemapper.

Linear curves are included for reference. Clamped to 1 and normalized to [0, 16], respectively.
